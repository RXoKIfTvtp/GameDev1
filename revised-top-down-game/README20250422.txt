Update 1:
There is a new input, Q for healing.

Inventory and crafting benches exist now. The invetory allows you to see pyour inventory, the light overlaps with them a 
lot but I couldn't be #$@$ed at this point to try and deal with the light clipping. The bench allows you to upgrade weapons.

Save files no longer go to the "Test" folder. Now they're stored in the user folder.

Zombies spawn in with several different sprites now for variety.

I might have fixed a few bugs? I can't remember, my perception of time is blending together.


Update 2:

Changed UI into CanvasLayers. Added melee with knife sound effects for hitting and missing.
